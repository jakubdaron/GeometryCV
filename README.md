# GeometryCV

The program recognizes basic geometric shapes from the image and provides their geometric dimensions. 

**Notice:**

The program recognizes shapes only when they are written or printed on grid paper and one of the grid in the right corner must be filled in, as it used to properly scale the objects!

# What version of OpenCV does the program use?

4.6.0

# How to use the program?
